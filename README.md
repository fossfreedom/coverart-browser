Then use the Favourites Threshold...

... to enable you to play your favourite albums and tracks in those albums:

Lets say you have given some albums a rating - 5 stars, 4 stars, 3 stars etc.

You select lots of albums - right click and chose "add to rated playlist" - only those albums that have a rating are added to the playlist.

You can adjust this in the preferences - favourites threshold. If you set a threshold of - for example - 3 stars, then only albums rated 3 stars and higher are added.

You can fine-tune this with individual tracks - lets say you have 10 tracks in an album. You like only 5 of them. Give the 5 tracks a rating. Then you can play, queue or add just those "favourite" tracks to a playlist.


 - Define your own preferences

 - Find embedded covers

 New plugin (Edit - Plugins - CoverArt Embedded Cover Search).  When enabled, searches for cover images embedded in tracks within an album.

 *Tip* - untick the default Cover Art Search plugin if you only want to force the search for embedded covers. 

 - icon-tooltip shows all the track artists for multi-artist albums
 - ... and a number of bug-fixes as well.

*How to install:*

for fedora and similar:

    yum install git gettext python-mako python-mutagen python-requests python-lxml

<pre>
rm -rf ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/coverart_browser

</pre>

*For Ubuntu 12.04 & 12.10:*

This is now available in my rhythmbox PPA - installation instructions in this AskUbuntu Q&A:

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

For Ubuntu 12.04 users that have upgraded to Rhythmbox v2.98 using the webupd8 PPA, this version 
of rhythmbox crashes when used with python plugins such as coverart-browser and replaygain.

It is strongly recommended that you either upgrade to 12.10 where v2.98 works great, or 
downgrade to v2.96 or v2.97 as per:
 - http://askubuntu.com/questions/201093/how-do-i-downgrade-rhythmbox-v2-98
