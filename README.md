**Please help out with translating**

We need you to help us translate the english text to your native language.

Don't worry - it is easier that you think.

Instructions are in the file TRANSLATE_README. Post a link to the file as a new issue, or
if you are feeling generous - fork and push a pull-request. Thanks!

If they look scary - just email me (foss dot freedom at gmail dot com) and I'll send you the 
file that needs to be translated - it is less than 20 text strings so it should only take a
few minutes.

When emailing - tell me your locale & language.  You can find these by typing:

    echo $LANG
    echo $LANGUAGE
