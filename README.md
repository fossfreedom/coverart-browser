*How to install - Rhythmbox 3.0 and later:*

N.B. for earlier Rhythmbox versions use version 1.x

Prerequisite is to use a distribution supporting GTK 3.10 or later - for example, Ubuntu 14.04, Arch or Fedora 20

for Debian & Debian-based distros such as Ubuntu & Mint:

    sudo apt-get install git gettext python3-mako gir1.2-notify-0.7 python3-lxml python3-gi-cairo python3-cairo gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad rhythmbox-plugins gir1.2-webkit-3.0

for Fedora and similar:

    sudo yum install git gettext python3-mako python3-lxml python3-cairo webkitgtk3

NOTE: it is assumed that you have separately installed the patent encumbered codecs found in the good/bad & ugly packages
To install the plugin:

<pre>
rm -rf ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/coverart_browser
git clone https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser.git
cd coverart-browser
./install.sh
</pre>

To make it work on debian buster (10), you need to add the stretch repository (as the necessary packages stopped at stretch). Don't worry, this tip has already been tested and it doesn't break the system.

<pre>
echo "deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian stretch main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gir1.2-webkit-3.0
</pre>


To uninstall the plugin:

<pre>
cd coverart-browser
./install.sh --uninstall
</pre>

Note 1 - the CoverArt Browser plugin also requires installing the following plugin:

 - https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-search-providers

*For Ubuntu 14.04 and later:*

V2.1.2 is now available in my rhythmbox PPA - installation instructions in this AskUbuntu Q&A:

http://askubuntu.com/questions/147942/how-do-i-install-third-party-rhythmbox-plugins

Note - installing the package `rhythmbox-plugin-coverart-browser` will also install `rhythmbox-plugin-coverart-search`
